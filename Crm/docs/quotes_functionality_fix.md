# Quotes Functionality Fix

This document provides instructions on how to fix the quotes functionality in the CRM system.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Missing Database Tables**: The quotes functionality was trying to access tables and columns that didn't exist in the database.
2. **Inventory Table Schema Mismatch**: The code was trying to access fields like `price`, `quantity_in_stock`, `features`, and `image_url` that didn't exist in the inventory table.
3. **Missing Services Table**: The services table was completely missing from the database.

## How to Fix

### 1. Run the SQL Script

Run the provided SQL script to create the necessary tables and columns:

```bash
psql -U your_username -d your_database -f scripts/create_quotes_tables.sql
```

Or execute the SQL script through the Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to the Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `scripts/create_quotes_tables.sql`
4. Run the script

### 2. Code Changes Made

The following code changes were made to fix the issues:

1. **OfferGenerator.tsx**:
   - Updated the inventory query to match the actual database schema
   - Added data transformation to include the required fields
   - Used sample services data until the services table is created

2. **InventoryItem Type**:
   - Updated the type definition to match the transformed data

### 3. Testing

After applying the fixes, test the quotes functionality:

1. Navigate to the quotes page at `/quotes`
2. Try to create a new quote
3. Select a customer, add products and services
4. Generate the quote and verify it works correctly

## Future Improvements

1. **Create Services Table**: Implement a proper services table in the database with CRUD functionality.
2. **Update Inventory Table**: Add proper support for product features, images, and pricing.
3. **Add Validation**: Implement better validation for the quote generation form.
4. **Improve Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling for database operations.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues after applying these fixes:

1. **Check Console Errors**: Look for any errors in the browser console.
2. **Verify Database Schema**: Make sure the SQL script was executed successfully.
3. **Check Network Requests**: Verify that the API requests are working correctly.
4. **Clear Browser Cache**: Try clearing your browser cache and reloading the page.
